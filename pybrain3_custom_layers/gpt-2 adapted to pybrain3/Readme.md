# GPT-2 now uses numpy? What gives?

The version here uses numpy & Scipy instead of tensorflow. The choice was for simplified remodeling later so it had the proper layers, layout, and basic functionality.

``pybrain3`` allows for similar imitation but further reduces the potential for error. Beyond that, test as you'd like as this version was not written by a proprietary company.
