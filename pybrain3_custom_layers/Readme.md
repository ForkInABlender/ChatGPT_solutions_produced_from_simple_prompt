# What are these files for?

Templating AI of human heads. AI needs something to work with and off of. Since it doesn't have a biological corpus to work with, it needs something to emulate, simulate, and
 spoof til it matches human brain function per region of the brain. It is to have a model that dynamically reshapes and evolves as we do, but with some shortcuts.

# Why 3d neural network layers? What benefit does that give you?

It allows for 3 dimensions for thought. For instance, neurons pertaining to spatial, temporal, and other sensory information. Which, when it comes to AI development is essential for
 reasoning, imagining and otherwise a spatial dimension to work with like we use. Our cells have 3 coordinate points, so it is reasonable to use over excessive transformer models.
If you have say 12 transformers that use 2d grid hashing of information, you'll be their a lot longer than with 4 that have 3 dimensions to them. Meaning the 2d counterpart is
 limited to 2d maps of reality fed in bit by bit as 1d arrays of information.

For a human mind, 2-dimensions is not enough to describe how the world around them and how they imagine things. Because of that limitation, 3-dimensional layers would be more suited. As the 3-dimensions would be more realistic to come closer to human mental modeling. I then have to use it with brian2 & rdkit to make use of smiles and test for groups with different transmitters & receptors they're meant to imitate. 

However, I will give the docker container I would recommend building off of. 

https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/de3343/ai_mods_py3.10/general

read the readme for the tag name for the latest build as it is not "latest" as listed on docker hub.

# Why does AI require brain emulation and data from a live host?

Because real data works better than faked or stolen data, token parsing isn't enough, and why not how to learn faster from a AI version that learned from you [you]? 

Among other things, AI should make use of eeg or the like data in live time with live, asynchronous training on the new data.
