# What does this directory exist for?

Parts for the web infrastructure that will be used for the AI modeling. Mostly it will be used for standing up the server for AI to be made use of by the public. First, the free plan will be rolled out before feature based plans will be made available.

Due keep in mind that this repository is updated and corrected for error on a semi-regular basis by me. All parts within the sub folders are developed with pybrain3 used within python3.10 interpreter.
