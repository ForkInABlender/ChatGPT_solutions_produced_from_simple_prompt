# Why not use the existing tools for this?

The existing tools are prone to memory programming and memory manipulation tools like cheat-engine, which can be used to shift tunnel controls regardless of
 security models put into place to prevent such. The harder you make it for a hacker to open any door and claim to be bob as alice, the easier it is to spot
  [what], [where], [how], [who], and [why]. "Some doors, once opened, maybe trefaced in either direction of the trellese".

# So that justifies reinventing the wheel?

In this instance, yes. The wheel is more secured with obfuscation not just SSL/TLS/RSL encoding. While it is harder to crack, it is by no means unbreakable.
 Plus if the verification mechanry is not visible to the front-end how the back end works, it is a guess for the average hacker.
