# Why not use existing desktop streaming apps? Wouldn't that be simpler?

No, as they are poorly designed and easily hackable. If anyone can just bend one aspect of a stream with cheat-engine, they automatically have control of the
 stream & Strata. So, no, not even remotely simpler. In fact, some security features are openly letting hackers in like having an unneeded firewall. At best, 
  they're good anti-features that stifle but not mitigate point of entry.

# So instead you're going to use your own custom version that lacks many features?

Yep. That's the point. Reduced attack surface and reduced points of failure are required. Otherwise it would not be ready for use with production code.

# So are you going to use common security and encryption patterns?

No, as it is the first point of failure. It is easier to develop such by hand to equally compress the data.
