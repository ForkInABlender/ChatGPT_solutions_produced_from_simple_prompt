# Dylan Kenneth Eliot & GPT-4o ( Alpha Edition )


"""
This is to be paired with ctypes to by patch in another module allow direct access to functions in windows binaries, then bind to their symbols while
 imitating windows kernel responses.

This is useful for when you need a application to run separate from the operating system it is built for.

The aim is to use something like this instead of wine. Wine is clunky and built wrong. Qiling is too heavy to run on a cell-phone.

Instead, unicorn engine, and ctypes type matching while mapping out each function before use is the best alternative. This also allows for direct binding
 based on name and expected location. Later on, it could be fleshed out to a full binary interpreter deprecated from OS & kernel dependence.
