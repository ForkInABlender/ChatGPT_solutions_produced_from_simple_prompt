<!-- Dylan Kenneth Eliot & GPT-4-plugins

Because this is uses THREE.js with brython.js and was written by GPT-4, it goes here. I did retool it so the errors stopped cropping it up.

What it does is create a cube with a mesh and a color. It then rotates the cube given the space it is placed at. In this case, center of the 
 canvas. This lets us set the end user customize their apps for the web. Including the 3d ones for more efficient development and runtime.
In addition, this gives the end user a way to simplify the complex part but keep the functionality of their code as well. The more moving parts
 they have to keep track of, the less valuable it is to them as developers.

This example is worth templating from. When paired with flask & jython, it works great. This also lets you define custom animations the simple,
 elegant way without a lot of hoop jumping. This also allows for multiple renders to be attached to the same window. Meaning you could define each
  object's render and animation separately, and keep each rendering block separate for each part you're aiming to render. For instance, you could
 set it up so that the scene, renderer, camera, and scene are accessible to each block. with no conflict, then make those separate parts 
  just as accessible. In that instance, you'd be defining how they look and are layed out or configured. The last part of connecting the dots
   would be assinging a location to those objects rules on how they interact in that webGL "world".
