&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How one might use the python module CPPYY to use minecraft and play it without violating terms of service, user agreements, or right to privacy. 1-304 of the UCC fair use law applies here as it adheres to science, data science, math, neurology, and programming. This also exists for the purposes of teaching people who are into minecraft programming and how to do scope analysis as well as the point of interception. An improper example is no example at all.
