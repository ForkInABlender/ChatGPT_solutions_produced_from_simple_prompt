# Dylan Kenneth Eliot & GPT-4-plugins (Alpha edition)

"""
This was created to simplify how I want the machine to do backup and restore of a stack. It basically is meant for doing live kubernetes pod process backup
 and restore after spawning bash shells for writing into and injecting into for new kubernetes pods spawned on a different part of the cluster.
  Or rather a option to relocate the running pod in live time or realatime.

The reason that this should work is because due to the logic of, "well we paused the process and looked at its stack, and the things the stack contained.
 then moved it, and in the new place, told it where it was last, its last parts in memory, and how to resume".

By the same token, a person could misuse this type of code for malice. So, use wisely, please. With that said, it should run in the new place without fail.
 As long as it has all the dependencies, and files or similar data structures to function.
