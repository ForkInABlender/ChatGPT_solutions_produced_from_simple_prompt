# How to add humanization back into your GPT model:

* take the prompt you expect it to respond to
* copy its response into each websites' checker
* take the percentages and text that reads as NLP generated content
* ask gpt-3/4 to humanize based on that data and reformulate its prior response

Rarely will it fall out of a human-baseline for text based content generation.
