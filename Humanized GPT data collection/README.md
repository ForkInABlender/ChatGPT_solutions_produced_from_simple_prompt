# How to add humanization back into your GPT model:

* take the prompt you expect it to respond to
* copy its response into each websites' checker
* take the percentages and text that reads as NLP generated content
* ask gpt-3/4 to humanize based on that data and reformulate its prior response

Rarely will it fall out of a human-baseline for text based content generation.

This is good for when you want your version separate from openai's model. The more human you encourage it to be with these types of checkers & metrics, the easier it becomes to make it closer to human in generic text generation.
