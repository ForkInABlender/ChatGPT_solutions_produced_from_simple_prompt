# Why minecraft & Python3.10?

Minecraft allows for sandboxed interactions. Python makes many points in execution of code very flecible as a c++ based runtime. 

Jython and the like weren't good enough for the type of inter-language inter-runtime perefusion of execution. Jpype had a better interface. Minecraft has many silly features.

But it has preprogrammed "decisions" for its npc's. The reason I don't condone AI based video game development is video game development underminds what is needed for a human mind 
 to express itself creatively. Minecrafts' initial development team didn't limit all of what the user can do. It limited what couldn't be done. 

What it would allow for AI development as a video game instead is a space for a human mind to make use. Otherwise, the human mind in AI terms would be floating in free space.
 unable to do anything about it while aware of itself and what it learned per say. While minecraft is a video game, I would not build AI into it. But around and making use of it,
 sure. Make use of minecraft with AI doing UI feedback looping over the context it has to operate with, different story. As that is making use of minecraft is meant to be temporary.

The goal is to use it to aide in modeling neural networks that can accept a 3-d environment and have similar periferal vision as humans do while playing the game. Later on, this can
 be expanded to having a network modeled for "imagining" what next it can do. Then give it something more to work with.


# Why GTK and OpenGL in addition in python?

Ease of development. The only thing that is being done different is how it is made use of. OpenGL in python allows me to hide away the rendering that the AI would do on a GPU.
 For instance, you're using an intel gpu on a dell office computer. I personally don't envy hopping through code bases and drivers for a simple answer stairing at me.
 PyOpenGL worked for using OpenGL targeting a mesa driver, where the gtk framework would work on other builds.
