&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is as the name implies. The solutions of which go here. Both for educational and work purposes. Or building personal experience for getting into the tech field. Communication is important, including knowing how NOT to say it. This is also for those who are looking for a simple way to change from a crap to a better one.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPeople who work in the fast food industry don't get a fair wage. And, I am tired of being treated like dirt by crap employers. So, as a result of people being assholes to one another about money, politics and other forms of interaction, now a machine can aide the Affected. Now the effect is going to be that their will be code to out-perform them. Likely in many domains. Including how to build a version of the cloud they can host within their cellphones.
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis repository will include:
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp * python code
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp * linux command line code for using docker
<br>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp * tips, tricks, and hints for getting chatGPT-3 to get closer what you were looking on

There will also by content on my youtube channel so you may also use it as a guide as well.

Any and all code I can get it to produce will be tested by hand. That includes edits done by hand. While I know what I am doing, others may not and need a really good example to work off of. However, you can't imitate or copy every little thing even about ladybugs. Sometimes, they're just that unique like zebras and no two are born with the same pattern unless they're twins.
