# What is this for and why not just compile down?

While compiling down has many benefits, doing it the least number of times as possible is better. In this case, if you don't have to compile at all, all the better.

My reverse ask is "Why compile what will run with a few interchanges to parts layout for language compatibility? Why not use the raw format with the right type castings without compiling?".
