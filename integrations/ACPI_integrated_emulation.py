# Dylan Kenneth Eliot & GPT-4 ( Alpha Edition )


"""
This is hardware emulation code embedded in python code.
Lets say you don't have a device that has adequate hardware
 but can accept acpi calls.
Instead of emulation if the entire board, you need 1 part.
 For example, you need to emulate PTTX executive switch points.
  This kind of Emulation of hardware makes it easier to develop
 without the need to worry about having the right hardware.


```
sudo apt-get install acpica-tools acpi acpi-support
git clone https://github.com/mkottman/acpi_call.git
cd acpi_call
make
sudo make install
sudo modprobe acpi_call
```

and the script below for direct interaction snd integration with virtual hardware.
