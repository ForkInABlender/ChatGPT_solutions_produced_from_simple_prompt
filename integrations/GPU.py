Because this was a bit of a coin toss, I honestly expected to junk more code.

This instead turned out to be useful. What it does is allows one to use a javacript module for functional computation against the problem without needing the
 physical GPU to be present. This gives the advantage of not needing real hardware to do the same calculation, only a smarter approach.
 This gives the benefit of being able to be run from the browser as well. Making it easier for developers that need to calculate a sum really quickly without
  wasting time worrying about hardware specific drivers.


For developers of pytorch, it could mean remodeling the gpu specific code it normally relies on to use a similar approach. This would also be useful for
 libraries like pybrain3 or pybrain itself. Where real hardware for such matters less.
