"""
Basically, it follows normal ICMP packet rules. Nothing special, just sends a message towards the IP with the ICMP packet.
 And if they're not listening to it at that level, they're not gonna hear, smell, see, or know of it. Even though they'll have received it.

This can lead to ping floods with random data type escaped such that when it is parsed, the program using it might see it as a potential functional call
 with some parameters that it has passed to itself as a internal directive during execution. Basically, if they don't know that ICMP is a door one can close,
  to a hacker, it remains open door, as per its policy and maintainer. While I don't encourage hacking someone else, for fun or nefarious use, please use
 this wisely.
