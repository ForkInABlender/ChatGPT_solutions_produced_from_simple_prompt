# Dylan Kenneth Eliot & GPT-4-plugins (Alpha Edition)

"""
So, this is the basic alternative to something like unity or unreal engine.


The format is smaller, and slimmer. With the lightweight model to design, and graphics, this allows for ease of use and development.
 This is not going to be paired, by me, with any AI code. As a living mind isn't meant to be trapped inside a video game. :) Including the 
  "adolf h. the artistic and engineer doctor". :)

 This can, however, be paired with the pybrain3 and gpt-2 based transformer docker hub containers listed below:

    https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/de3343/ai_mods_py3.10/general
    https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/de3343/gpt-neo-app/general
 With this in mind, I cannot halt you from misuse for AI in said video games. :) However, if your video game is to house a mind so it has 
  something to use to interact with the external world like we do, perhaps that is ethical and fair use. And that I will accept. What is not is
   to do is to use it to imitate for purposes of harassment or bullying.

Beyond that, free reign. Do as you will with it. If it helps someone you know, all the better.
