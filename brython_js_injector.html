<!-- Dylan Kenneth Eliot & GPT-4-plugins (Alpha Edition)

So, GPT sort of made this in an attempt to meet a different request. But it finally met one of my other curiousities. To my surprise, it succeeded.
 But in doing so, it also allowed for another cool trick. Meaning one could probably load ruby after it was put through source-to-source compilation for
  it to be javascript compatible. Then one can use said ruby code inside the browser with brython & flask server run with jython libraries. Then one would be
   able to use ruby with python, javascript, html, and java. And the point of doing such is to allow for ease of development as well as reduce complexity by
  allowing for more flexibility in definition functionality of what the web apps do. I would consider doing something similar for testing & developing code.
 What I would say it would be needed for is something like gpu.js, where it is giving the developer some compatibility issues. (threads in javascript land are
  sort of important, and the brython.js developer was busy with other things, likey) As you should see in the code, it provides a way to add code to make two
   ordinarily imcompatible portions of execution compatible. This glue made it easier to narrow the gap while using gpu.js and brython.js
 Where it'd come in handy is when one needs to use a modified copy of brain.js to do what pybrain3 can do, but with javascript & python logic. Steering clear
  as much as possible away from nodejs, transformers, pytorch, pyodide, etc. Because it has to be super light weight while maintaining compatibility.
